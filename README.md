Trying to learn how to use github using an old university project.


# HRY418-project-1

Parallelize a simple program using openMP and pthreads, in C, with three task sizes. Use the script to compile and run all the files.

The program creates two equally sized arrays containing random strings and counts identical characters in the same position. Also it holds the time that needs to find all identical characters.


# Script Variables

'A' and 'B' are the size of the arrays, 'LENGTH' is the size of the strings in the arrays and 'THREADS' is the number of the threads that will be used in the parallel executions.
